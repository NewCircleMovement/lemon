# LemonGold app

At the moment the actual development happens in https://github.com/rasmuserik/solsort-util ie.:

https://github.com/rasmuserik/solsort-util/blob/master/src/solsort/apps/lemon.cljs

this is due to that it is co-developed with the app platform it is using, and thus it is easier to develop together in the same repository.

The app will later be moved into this repository.
